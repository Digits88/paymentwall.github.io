MINT was created by Paymentwall in 2013 as a prepaid payment method for purchasing digital goods and services. MINT was developed with the goal of providing users a safer and easier alternative to credit cards or bank transfers for online payments. As a chargeback-free and low-risk payment method, MINT is the perfect payment solution for people who value privacy and security of their personal information.
