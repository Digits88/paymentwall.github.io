Teleingreso is an offline payment, the customer receives a code and can pay either at retail shops (disashop network) or via ATMs (Abanca network).

It enables Spanish consumers to pay for goods and services purchased online using a variety of offline payment methods including more than 3,000 ATMs, 2,000 post offices and 300 retail outlets throughout Spain. When a consumer selects Teleingreso as a payment method while shopping online, the system automatically generates a unique 9-digit transaction code. The transaction is then pending until the consumer visits any of the Teleingreso payment outlets to make a cash payment, after which the information is provided to the merchant, who then sends out a confirmation email of receipt of the funds. Paying via online banking is also possible with Spanish banks Novagalicia Banco, Cajamar and EVO Banco.
