UniPin Express offers prepaid cards mostly for gaming. After obtaining a UniPin voucher from any Indomaret Convenient Store nationwide in Indonesia, gamers will then enter the Serial and PIN code printed on the voucher in the UI.

All UniPin Express transactions amount are consumed in full. If gamers reload with UniPin Express using a RP10,000 voucher, once the transaction is complete, the entire amount is consumed. No balance of the voucher will be kept. Thus, it is advisable for merchants to revise pricing strategy to match the amounts supported by UniPin Express.
