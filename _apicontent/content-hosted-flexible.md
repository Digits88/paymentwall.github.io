## Flexible product

Flexible product is the most common choice for merchants who prefer to define products by themselves, it requires digital goods API and the product details need to be passed while calling our widget.

By using flexible product, only one product will be displayed in our widgets, which means you will need to write your own pages so that your user could choose products.
