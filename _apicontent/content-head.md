# API Reference

This API reference consists of all the APIs provided by Paymentwall. The Paymentwall API can be interacted with *HTTPS* requests to obtain certain information from Paymentwall. Typically a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object including the required details will be returned except *Widget API* & *Checkout API*, which redirect your customer to Paymentwall websites for hosted checkout payment experience.   

If you have any suggestions or confusion about our reference pages, please create a issue directly on our [Github](https://github.com/paymentwall/paymentwall.github.io).
