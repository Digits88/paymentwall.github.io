# Widget API

*Widget* is a payment page hosted by Paymentwall where users complete all the steps of the payment process: selecting the payment method, selecting the price point/product and completing the payment. The price points are configured via Paymentwall merchant dashboard.

> For Offerwall Widgets, see [Offerwall Integration](/integration/widget/offerwall).  

## Payment Widget Flow
Here's how a payment widget flow looks like for *All Payment Methods*:  
<div class="docs-img">
    <img src="/textures/pic/integration/widget/widget_multi.png" style="max-width: 100%" />
</div>
Steps:  
1. User selects one of the available payment methods.  
The methods are automatically geo-targeted based on the IP address. Users from Brazil will only see Brazilian payment methods. Merchants can configure the list of active methods in Paymentwall merchant dashboard. More about [Payment Methods](#payment-methods).
To show only one payment method, see [Single Payment Method](#single-payment-method).  
2. The user selects one of the available price points. If you want to pass a specific price from your system, please refer to [Checkout API](/integration/checkout-home) instead.  
The price points can be:
* [Virtual Currency](/integration/widget/virtual-currency) packages such as 100 Credits, 200 Credits.  
For some specific methods, such as Mobiamo (Mobile Carrier Billing), Paymentwall will automatically calculate the amount of Credits based on the prices that operators support in that country. For example 120 Credits for 1 EUR, 240 Credits for 2 EUR.
* [Digital Goods](/integration/widget/digital-goods), for example:
  * one-time products, such as Lifetime License, Extended Lifetime License  
  * subscription packages, such as Monthly Basic Subscription, Monthly Premium Subscription  
3. User completes the purchase.  
4. Paymentwall sends a [pingback](#pingback-payment-notifications) - server-side payment notification to the merchant.
5. The widget page sends a [client-side callback](#success-page) to the parent window (if used via iframe).
5. Paymentwall redirects the user to the [success page](#success-page).

***  
## Single Payment Method  
If you would like to skip step 1 and pre-define the *Single Payment Method* (e.g. only credit cards), you can pass API parameter ```ps=$method_name``` and the widget will look like this:  
<div class="docs-img">
    <img src="/textures/pic/integration/widget/widget_uni.png"/>
</div>

The value to be passed in ```ps``` parameter can be found in [Payment System Shortcodes reference](/reference/payment-system-shortcodes) or dynamically via [Payment Systems API](/apis#section-tools-payment-systems).

## Displaying a Widget

You can direct users to a *Widget* in a few ways:
* Embed as an iframe inside of your website.
* Embed as a webview inside of your mobile application. See [Mobile SDKs](/integration/sdks/mobile-home).
* Redirect as a standalone page.

Please select the [API type](#choose-the-api-type) for instructions relevant to your use case (*Digital Goods* or *Virtual Currency*).

***

## Payment Methods

Payment methods which are displayed on the widget depends on the userâ€™s IP address and configuration of the Payment Systems in your project. For each project, you can make adjustments on the activated payment methods and their country coverage at Payment System section in [My Projects](https://api.paymentwall.com/developers/applications) depending on your business needs.

Refer to [payment methods](/payment-method/credit-card) for the payment methods supported by *Widget API* in each country.

***

## Pingback Payment Notifications

Once a user makes a payment with the payment method and the product they choose, we will notify your server using server-side [Pingback](/reference/pingback-home).

***

## Success Page

Once a user makes a payment, they will be redirected to the Success page, which you can pass via ```success_url``` API parameter.

## Client-side callback

Additionally, if Paymentwall Widget is embedded via iframe, it will send a [client-side callback](/reference/client-side-callback), that can be received with JavaScript.
> To enable client side callback, please contact to devsupport@paymentwall.com with your Paymentwall account email address.

## Choose the API type

Choose the API type which will better fit your application.

* [Digital Goods](/integration/widget/digital-goods). Any game or website that has in-game virtual items, digital contents, full version of a game or software, Saas, and any one-time payment products.
* [Virtual Currency](/integration/widget/virtual-currency). Any game or website that has Gold, Rubies, Gems, Rupees, Emeralds, Credits and any other virtual currency economy.
* [Offerwall](/integration/widget/offerwall). Offerwall allows users to get Virtual Currency for free without making payments. This works well for games and other applications that have virtual currency economy.
